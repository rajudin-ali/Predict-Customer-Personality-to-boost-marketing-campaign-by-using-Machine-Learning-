- Customers with an income of 80–120 million IDR show the highest conversion rate (around 18–19%), significantly outperforming lower-income groups (<20 million IDR with ~10%). This suggests that upper-middle-income customers are more likely to convert compared to lower or higher extremes.

- Conversion rate strongly increases with spending categories. Customers in the “Very High” spending group (Q4) have a conversion rate of over 12%, which is far higher than the lower spending groups (<3%). This indicates that high-spending customers are the most valuable segment for driving conversions.

- The 30–50 years group shows the highest conversion rate (5.2%), making it the most promising segment.
- The >70 years group also performs strongly (5%), indicating a significant opportunity in the senior segment.
- The 50–70 years group has the lowest rate (3.6%), which may require tailored marketing approaches to boost conversions.
- The <30 years group is moderate (4%), showing potential but not as high as older groups.

- Single and “Other” categories record the highest conversion rates (~19–20%), far above engaged (~10.5%) and married (~11%). This may indicate that single individuals or those outside traditional marital categories are more receptive to conversions compared to people in stable family commitments.
